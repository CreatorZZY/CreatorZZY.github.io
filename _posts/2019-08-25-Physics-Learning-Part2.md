# Part 2

## P34 What is the strength of the basic force?

## P37 The tension at the ends of Microelementdsshould be understood as the force can be changed. (Think as function. )
This topic has been thinking for a while:
Why can the tension that reverses at any point on the cylinder generate pressure and can generate friction?I figured it out later: Should analyze the force of an arc(The relationship between Infinitesimal and zero)

## P42 Integral operation of Expression(4) of Example2
free C calculation.
But The upper and lower limits of the points must correspond, so that makes sense

## P43 One of the principles of the governor
Interesting！！！

## P44 Explain the necessary and necessary questions when Vector equation decomposition into scalar equation
In fact, it is such a problem: $f(x)i + g(y)j = 0$

## P45 Viscous drag of an object moving in a fluid
Interesting！！！

## P50 Introduction of the concept of centrifugal force
