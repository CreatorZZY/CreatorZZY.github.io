# Part 1

> Yesh! I know my english is improving, but i still want to write in english:)

## P7 Constrained speed with length（Different from high school method: speed decomposition）
Note: Hypothesis the Point coordinates with (x,y).

## P14 Deducing the formula of circular motion acceleration
Attention!!!
Note: The vector of the vector function takes the unit vector.

## Relative speed Calculation in Reference System
The relative speed of Reference System S'' relative to Reference System S' is **u**. The relative speed of Reference System S'relative to Reference System S is **v**. Figure：
$$S''→（u）->S'→（v）->S$$
The last step is vector summation.
